# Calories Burned Prediction using Machine Learning (Regression Use Case)

## 📋 Project Overview
Calorie burn prediction is a critical aspect of fitness tracking, enabling individuals to understand their energy expenditure during exercise more effectively. This project implements a regression-based approach to estimate calories burned based on user-provided input data. It serves as a valuable tool for personal health monitoring and fitness tracking.

## 🔍 Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned during an activity using features such as age, weight, duration, and heart rate.

## 🛠️ Features
The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Age**: Age of the individual (in years).
- **Weight**: Weight of the individual (in kilograms).
- **Duration**: Duration of the activity (in minutes).
- **Heart Rate**: Average heart rate during the activity (in beats per minute).
- **Calories**: The target variable representing calories burned.
